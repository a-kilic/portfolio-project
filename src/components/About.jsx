            Hello! I'm a passionate web developer with a focus on building
            responsive and engaging user experiences. I love coding,
            problem-solving, and turning complex ideas into simple, intuitive
            designs.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            With a background in front-end development, I have expertise in
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. I also enjoy
            learning new technologies and am constantly seeking opportunities to
            improve my skills and take on exciting challenges.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, reading
            books, or working on personal projects that push my creative limits.
          </p>
