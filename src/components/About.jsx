            Hi there! I'm a front-end developer with over a year of experience
            creating responsive and engaging websites. I work with JavaScript,
            TypeScript, and frameworks like React, along with HTML, CSS,
            Tailwind, and Bootstrap.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            I love tackling new challenges and continuously improving my skills
            through personal projects that spark my creativity.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying anime or gaming with
            friends ðŸ˜Š.
